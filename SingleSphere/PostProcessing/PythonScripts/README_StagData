This is info to help understand the datasets presented in this directory

The following dataframes should be included in the same directory:
Comma delimited
Only for the Small Sphere
1) StagPoint_r0.15m_Horizontal.csv
2) StagPoint_r0.15m_Vertical.csv

Horzontal: Perpendicular to Oscillation
Vertical: Parallel to Oscillation

Varible Clarification:
Both Dataframes:
1) Re_s = Streaming Reynolds Number = A^2/delta^2
2) St = r/A
3) Viscosity, Nu, is calculated from Re_s
4) Re_Paper = Paper Reynolds number = A*r/delta^2
(Since single sphere, don't worry about amp of small sphere. It is just amp)
5) epsilon = 1/St
6) Tvar = StagPos - r = 'T' which is the stag point dist in the published work about ellipsoids
7) Msquared = M^2 = Re_Paper/epsilon
8) Re_M = r^2/delta^2: Reynolds number used in ellipsoid paper
9) velChange: indicates a velocity change along line of sight in the simulation domain
10) direction: horizontal or vertical

Just Horizontal:
1) stagPos = distance from center of sphere to location where fluid velocity direction changes

Just Vertical:
1) stagPos = Takes into account the amplitude. It is the above minus the amplitude
